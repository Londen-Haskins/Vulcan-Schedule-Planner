# Overview
The schedule planner will give students the ability to generate a schedule that will go through their major all the way up until they graduate. The generated schedule will provide a four year grad plan to the best of its abilities. The Vulcan Schedule Planner will also take into account spring and fall classes, so if a student would join in spring their generated schedule will reflect that. Students will also be able to manually put in the classes they have taken to generate a schedule for a sophomore or a junior. There is also the ability to save the generated schedule by downloading a file and when you want to bring up that schedule with ease we have an uploader that will take the info on the file and instantly have every class taken recorded.
